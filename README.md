# Unison
UWP WhatsApp client aimed primarily for Windows 10 Mobile from porting Baileys
(secondary WhatsApp MD device client)

What works:

- Message sending
- Image sending
- Contact names via their ~ name - not true contact names from phone yet (wait to load)
- Profile pictures (wait a lot, be patient)
- Starting new chats with completely new numbers (I know, right?)

What needs to work:

- Session saving
- A lot more
