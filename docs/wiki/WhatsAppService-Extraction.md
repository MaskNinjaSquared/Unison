# WhatsAppService → façades

How the compatibility client becomes **connection-only** on this side of the boundary. Status of the work, then the remaining phases. Product history stays in [Changelog](Changelog); protocol/broker leftovers stay in [Migration](Migration).

**Goal:** ViewModels and views talk only to façades (`IConnectionService`, `IMessageService`, `IChatService`, `IContactService`, `IProfileService`, `IHistoryService`, `IStatusService`, plus new contracts this plan adds). `WhatsAppService` shrinks to socket lifecycle. Facades that are ready already reach `WhatsAppSession` via `IWhatsAppSessionProvider`.

**Partials are not façades.** `WhatsAppService.Avatars.cs` is still the same class as `WhatsAppService.cs`. The compiler merges them. Facades inject `IWhatsAppService` and call methods; they do not reference a partial file. Moving work to a façade means **cutting methods out of the class** and implementing them on `ContactFacade` / `MessageFacade` / …, not “wiring the façade to the partial”.

---

## Done: phase A — `IJidResolver`

Callers that only needed “is this the same person?” no longer name the client.

- Contract: `Unison.Core/Contracts/IJidResolver.cs` (`GetCanonicalJid`, `TryGetAlias`, `Self`)
- UWP: `JidResolver` wraps the concrete `WhatsAppService` alias table (table move is still later)
- Switched: Core helpers + `ParticipantResolutionContext`, ViewModels, UI shells, `ContactFacade` / policy helpers, `ChatFacade`, `MessageFacade`, `DebugSendService`, `CommentRichService`
- `IContactService.ResolveDisplayName` for name lookup without the client
- **Removed from `IWhatsAppService`:** `GetCanonicalJid`, `JidAlias`

---

## Done: phase 0 (mechanical)

No behaviour change for users. Prep so later diffs are one cluster, not a 16k-line blob.

### Dead code

- Unreachable legacy JSON history apply: `ProcessHistorySyncBodyAsync`, `StoreConversationTcTokenAsync`, `ApplyHistoryConversationPin`, `UseHistorySqliteApplyPath`. `ProcessHistorySyncCoreAsync` only notifies SQLite-path progress (`NotifyHistorySqliteChunkApplied`).
- Leftover types that were **never in the UWP csproj**: `Services/WhatsApp/MessageService.cs`, `ContactService.cs`, `ConnectionService.cs`, `ProfileService.cs`, and the duplicate `DebugSendService.cs` beside the façades. Live debug sender is `Diagnostics/DebugSendService.cs`.
- `SettingsViewModel` no longer takes unused `IWhatsAppService` (logout is `IConnectionService`).

### Partials

`public partial class WhatsAppService` — one type, many files under `src/Unison.Uwp/Services/WhatsApp/`:

| File | Cluster |
|---|---|
| `WhatsAppService.cs` | Fields, properties, ctor/`Create`/`Attach*`, send, history SQLite notify, leftovers |
| `WhatsAppService.Connection.cs` | Connect / resume / pairing / reconnect / suspend / broker transfer |
| `WhatsAppService.Media.cs` | On-demand decrypt + cache (`Ensure*AvailableAsync`) |
| `WhatsAppService.Groups.cs` | w:g2 metadata, members, send permissions |
| `WhatsAppService.Avatars.cs` | Fetch/apply/cache, group HQ + fallbacks |
| `WhatsAppService.Identity.cs` | Canonical JID, alias LID/PN, `ResolveDisplayName`, usync |
| `WhatsAppService.AppState.cs` | App-state appliers (pin, mute, delete, names) |
| `WhatsAppService.Persistence.cs` | chats.json debounce, load persisted UI, suspend tail |
| `WhatsAppService.Receipts.cs` | Receipt nodes → send state |
| `WhatsAppService.IncomingPump.cs` | Decrypted-message queue, placeholders, offline replay summaries |

`IWhatsAppService` is unchanged as the façade-facing surface (minus the deleted history body). Do not grow it for UI; add members on the façade that owns the subject ([Coding standards](Coding-Standards) §6).

---

## Done: phase 1 — the UI frontier

No logic moved. The UI stopped naming the client; every member below is still implemented in
`WhatsAppService` and reached through a façade that forwards.

| Was on `IWhatsAppService` | New owner |
|---|---|
| `Chats` | `IChatStateStore.Chats` |
| `GetCanonicalJid`, `JidAlias` | `IJidResolver` (phase A; table still on the concrete client until 3.7) |
| `ResolveDisplayName`, `PhoneContactNamesByJid`, `MarkAvatarImageLoadFailed` | `IContactService` |
| `RefreshGroupSendPermissionsAsync`, `EnsureGroupRosterLoadedFromStoreAsync`, `EnsureHighQualityGroupAvatarAsync` | new `IGroupService` / `GroupFacade` |
| `ClearUnreadForChatAsync`, `SetActiveChatJid`, `GetTotalUnreadCount`, `PersistChatListRowsPublic`, `ReconcileChatPreviewsFromSqliteAsync` | `IChatService` |
| `IsInitialSyncSafeMode`, `InitialSync*`, `IsLoadingPersistedChats`, `PreferFrugalSyncBudget` | `IHistoryService` |
| `InitializeConnectionStateAsync`, `IsRegisteredAsync`, `EnsureConnectedAsync`, `LoadPersistedUiStateAsync`, `StartDeferredStartupMaintenance`, `IsConnected` | `IConnectionService` |
| `ClearSessionAsync` (debug wipe) | `IConnectionService.ClearLocalSessionAsync` (already existed) |
| `VerboseLogging`, `SetVerboseLogging` | `IDiagnosticsConsole` → `IRuntimeDiagnostics` |

Two deviations from the original plan, both deliberate:

- Verbose logging went to `IDiagnosticsConsole`, **not** `IDebugSendService`. That service is
  registered under `#if DEBUG`, so a Release `DebugViewModel` could not have taken it. The console
  is the debug pane's surface and already exposes `IsCaptureEnabled` the same way.
- `BootView` / `MainView` no longer attach the UI dispatcher. `AttachUiDispatcher` needs a WinRT
  `CoreDispatcher`, which `IDispatcher` does not carry, so rather than widen that contract the
  attach moved to `App.ConfigureServices`, which already holds the root frame. The views stopped
  doing infrastructure wiring, which was the point.

`WhatsAppService.Instance` is gone from `ChatAvatarControl`. Note there are **two** compiled
`ChatDetailView` code-behinds (`UI/Views` and `Shell/Unison/Views`); both were converted.

**Verified:** `IWhatsAppService` appears in `src/Unison.Core` only as its own contract,
`IConnectionService.AttachWhatsAppService` (stays until phase 4) and two doc comments. Zero hits
under `src/Unison.Uwp/UI` and `src/Unison.Uwp/Shell`.

---

## Done: phase 2 — invert `Attach*` (the reportable half)

Each `AttachFoo` is a place the flow is born in the client. Where the call was a **report** —
fire-and-forget, no return value, no ordering the client depends on — it is now an event the client
raises and the façade subscribes to in its own constructor.

| Client event | Subscriber | Replaced |
|---|---|---|
| `OnStreamError` | `ConnectionFacade` | `AttachConnectionService` (gone) |
| `OnInvalidSessionSuspected` | `ConnectionFacade` | same |
| `OnLiveStatusReceived` | `StatusFacade` | `AttachStatusService` (gone) |
| `OnBackgroundHistorySyncBounced` | `HistoryFacade` | `AttachHistoryService` (gone) |
| `OnAvatarCached` | `ContactFacade` | part of `AttachContactService` |
| `OnJidAliasResolved` | `ContactFacade` | part of `AttachContactService` |

That let the push-in doors close on the contracts too. `NotifyStreamError`,
`NotifySuspectedInvalidSession`, `TryIngestLiveAsync`, `NoteBackgroundHistorySyncBounce` and
`ClearAvatarAttempted` are private to their façades now, because the client was their only caller.
`StatusFacade` gained an `IWhatsAppService` constructor parameter so it has something to subscribe
to; the other three façades already had one.

`ApplyGroupMetadataFromResponseAsync` lost its `hydrateAvatars` parameter: both call sites passed
`false`, so the `HydrateGroupMemberAvatarsAsync` branch behind it had never run.

### What phase 2 could not do

The original plan also listed `AttachMessageService`, `AttachPersonStore` and `AttachChatStore`
here. They do not invert, because those calls are not reports:

- `AttachMessageService` — two of the three call sites are **queries** the incoming pump branches
  on: `TryHandleReaction`, which answers through an `out` parameter, and `GetChatMessage`, which
  returns the mapped message. An event cannot return a value. The third blocks history apply until
  it completes. Inverting these means moving the pump's mapping out of the client, which is
  3.4 / 3.10.
- `AttachPersonStore` / `AttachChatStore` / `AttachGroupRosterStore` — the writes are interleaved
  with client state; roster replace and group membership persist both sit inside the group-metadata
  apply. Moving them *is* 3.2 / 3.8 / 3.9.

`AttachContactService` survives too, reduced from nine call sites to the two deferred-startup
maintenance ones (`RefreshPhoneContactOverlayAsync`, `RetrieveContactPicturesAsync`) plus the
`IWhatsAppService` pass-throughs. Those are orchestration: the client sequences them and depends on
the order.

---

## Current coupling (start here next session)

### Facades still depend on the client

`ContactFacade`, `MessageFacade`, `ChatFacade`, `GroupFacade`, `HistoryFacade`, `ProfileFacade`, `StatusFacade`, `ConnectionFacade` take `IWhatsAppService` (or `AttachWhatsAppService`). Policy is already on the façade; **primitives** (fetch avatar, send bytes, persist, canonical JID) still run inside the client.

Helpers under `Contacts/` (`ContactNameResolver`, `ChatAvatarPolicy`, `GroupRosterPolicy`, `AddressBookOverlay`) are the largest non-UI consumers of client members (`RunOnUiThreadAsync`, `SchedulePersistPublic`, `RaiseSyncStatus`, `FetchAndApplyAvatarAsync`, `FetchGroupMemberAvatarAsync`, `IsTransportReady`, …). Extracting avatars/names is mostly moving those primitives so the helpers stop needing the god client.

### DI still injects façades *into* the client

After `BuildServiceProvider`, `App.ConfigureServices` does:

- `AttachMessageService` / `AttachContactService`
- `AttachPersonStore` / `AttachChatStore` / `AttachGroupRosterStore`

That is the wrong direction: live ingest (status, names) **starts** in `WhatsAppService` and calls up. Phase 2 inverted the reportable half of it (client publishes; façade subscribes); the rest is blocked on phase 3 and is described below.

### What still holds the client

`App.xaml.cs` for lifecycle (`ResumeAsync`, `TransferActiveSocketToBrokerAsync`, `PrepareForSuspendAsync`, `ShutdownAsync`, `ReleaseMemoryAsync`, `IsConnected`, `AttachUiDispatcher`), the façades and their policy helpers, and `RuntimeDiagnosticsService` for health snapshots.

Raw `IWhatsAppService` **events** are façade-only; ViewModels should not subscribe there.

---

## Remaining phases

Do them in order. Phase 3.9 (list + persist) is last among the body moves because `ChatStateStore` still exposes transitional dictionaries that the client mutates on the UI thread. The `Attach*` calls phase 2 could not invert are folded into the steps that own them (3.2 / 3.4 / 3.8 / 3.9 / 3.10).

### Phase 3 — Move the clusters (the volume)

Self-contained first. List/persist last.

| Step | Partial / area | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1a | Avatar cache (done) | `IAvatarCache` / `AvatarCacheService` |
| 3.1b | Avatar fetch (done) | `AvatarFetcher`, behind `IUsyncGate` |
| 3.1c | Avatar apply to the row | with 3.2 (group fallback) and 3.9 (row + persist) |
| 3.2a | Group protocol reading (done) | `GroupMetadataReader` |
| 3.2b | Group apply + roster persist | `GroupFacade`, after 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.9 |
| 3.3a | Media cache + file naming (done) | `IMediaCache` / `MediaCacheService`, `MediaFileExtensions` |
| 3.3b | Derived renditions — transcode / poster / WebP (done) | `MediaDerivationService` |
| 3.3c | Download orchestration | `MessageFacade`. Contract already has `Ensure*AvailableAsync` |
| 3.4 | Send (main file) | `MessageFacade` over use cases; client only “send this node” |
| 3.5a | Receipt reading (done) | `ReceiptReader` |
| 3.5b | Receipt aggregation state | `MessageFacade` / `ChatFacade`, after 3.9 |
| 3.6 | Names / usync (`.Identity.cs`) | `ContactFacade` / `ContactDirectory`. Masked `*****` labels stay “no name” so projection can fill |
| 3.7a | Alias LID/PN + canonical (done) | `JidAliasTable` (Core), read through `IJidResolver` |
| 3.7b | Converge onto `LidMappingStore` | Blocked: that store is async, canonicalization is not. See below |
| 3.8 | `.AppState.cs` | **Rewritten — the premise was stale.** See below |
| 3.9a | List display order (done) | `ChatDisplayOrder` (Core) |
| 3.9b | `.Persistence.cs` + preview reconcile + the appliers from 3.8 | `ChatFacade` + `ChatStateStore` + `IChatStore` / `IMessageStore`. Close the transitional public dictionaries on `ChatStateStore`. **Pending message queue done — see below** |
| 3.10 | `.IncomingPump.cs` | Decode/dispatch stays with connection; apply (row, preview, unread, toast) goes to façades |

**3.1a is done.** The avatar half of `MediaCache` is `IAvatarCache` / `AvatarCacheService`: `TryGet`,
`SaveAsync`, `DeleteIfCached`. It took `BuildSafeAvatarFileName`, `TryGetCachedAvatarUri`,
`DownloadAndCacheAvatarAsync`, the static `AvatarHttpClient` and the file delete that was inline in
`MarkAvatarImageLoadFailed`. Callers now pass an `AvatarVariant` instead of the `"_high"` suffix.
`ProfileFacade` takes the cache directly, which let `CacheRemoteAvatarAsync` leave `IWhatsAppService`.

**The usync gate came out first.** The client held one `SemaphoreSlim` over every directory-style IQ,
shared by two clusters that are moving to different owners: profile-picture lookups (3.1) and usync
contact resolution (3.6). Moving avatar fetch out while names stayed behind would either leave the
lock in the client and force a half-move, or give avatars their own lock — which lets two IQ streams
run concurrently against the surface the lock exists to rate-limit. It is now `IUsyncGate` /
`UsyncGate`, handing out a disposable lease instead of the `WaitAsync` / `lockTaken` / `Release`
triple that was repeated at all five sites.

**3.1b is done: the fetch left, the apply stayed.** `AvatarFetcher` owns wire-and-disk — candidate
sweep, the gate, high-resolution, download — reaching the socket through
`IWhatsAppSessionProvider` so it needs no client reference. It touches no chat state, which is why it
can be called from a background batch, a row scrolling into view, or the group info pivot without any
of them agreeing about threads. `FetchBestProfilePictureResultAsync`, `GetProfilePictureAsync` and the
high-resolution loop are gone from the client; `GetProfilePictureUrlAsync` is a one-line forward.

Candidates are passed in rather than resolved inside, for two reasons: the PN/LID table is still the
client's until 3.7, and injecting `IJidResolver` here would close a DI cycle (`IJidResolver`
eagerly resolves `IWhatsAppService`, which now takes the fetcher).

What is left of avatars in the client is the **apply**, and it is deliberately parked: it writes
`ChatItem` rows on the UI thread and calls `SchedulePersist` (3.9), and the group-avatar fallback is
group-metadata protocol (3.2). Also staying is `ShouldDeferAvatarFetch` — it reads history backfill
and on-demand state, so it is history gating wearing an avatar name, and belongs with 3.9/3.10.

**3.2a is done: the parser left, the apply stayed.** `GroupMetadataReader` turns a `w:g2` response
into plain objects — subject, announce-only, member count, participant drafts, my role — plus the
list algebra the roster merge needs (`RosterJidSetsEqual`, `MergeInPlace`) and the placeholder-name
test. It holds no socket, no chat state and no dispatcher, so it is the first piece of the group
cluster that can be checked without watching rows change. `GroupListingEntry` and `GroupMemberDraft`
moved with it.

It takes **two functions** rather than `IJidResolver`: canonical JID, and "is this the logged-in
account". The second one reads the PN/LID alias table, which is still the client's until 3.7 — a
participant row can carry a device-suffixed PN whose base LID is the account's real identity, and
`IsSelfLinkedJid` is the only place that knows it. Reimplementing that in the reader would have been
a silent behaviour change in the role the composer trusts for announce-only groups. At 3.7 both
functions collapse into the resolver.

The rest of `.Groups.cs` is apply and orchestration, and it is blocked on three other steps, not on
itself: it walks `Chats` on the UI thread and calls `SchedulePersist` (3.9), writes `ContactNames`
and calls `ResolveDisplayName` (3.6), and canonicalises through the client's alias table (3.7). Move
it when those land, not before.

**3.3a is done: storage left, downloading stayed.** `IMediaCache` / `MediaCacheService` owns
`LocalFolder/MediaCache/{Images,Audio,Documents,Video,VideoPosters}`; `MediaFileExtensions` (Core,
pure) owns MIME to extension. Callers name a `MediaCacheKind` and a file base and get back an
`ms-appdata:` URI, instead of writing the "open MediaCache, then open the subfolder, then build the
URI by concatenation" sequence by hand at every save and lookup — 217 lines out of `.Media.cs`.

`SaveAsync` takes `reuseExisting` because the old call sites disagreed on purpose and the difference
is worth keeping: an image or a video keyed by message id is byte-identical on redownload, so the
write is skipped, while documents, posters and transcodes are things we produced and may reproduce.

Two follow-ups, both real:

- The same folder boilerplate is still duplicated in `OggOpusToWavConverter`,
  `OggOpusHandlerService` and `HistoryThumbnailMaterializer`. They should take `IMediaCache`. Left
  out of 3.3a deliberately — the audio path is the fragile one on Mobile and deserves its own change.
- ~~`TryTranscodeOggOpusToM4aAsync` still opens the Audio folder itself.~~ Resolved in 3.3b.

**3.3b is done: the second renditions left.** `MediaDerivationService` owns the four things that
exist only because Windows 10 Mobile ships a narrower set of codecs than the desktop, and WhatsApp
sends for the desktop: the PNG sibling of a WebP, the platform PNG re-encode, the Ogg/Opus to M4A
transcode, and the first-frame video poster. 216 lines out of `.Media.cs`. The original payload
always stays on disk; every one of these is an addition next to it.

It takes `MediaCacheService` rather than `IMediaCache`, which is the point 3.3a could not reach:
`MediaTranscoder` encodes into a `StorageFile` it is handed, and a Core interface cannot produce one.
Both sides are UWP, so there was never anything to abstract — the only reason it looked like a
problem in 3.3a was that the holder was the client, which talks to Core contracts. The container now
registers the concrete type and maps `IMediaCache` onto it.

What is left in the client is 3.3c: `Ensure*AvailableAsync`, `EnsureWebPDisplayUriAsync` and
`EnsurePlayableAudioUriAsync`. Those read and write `ChatMessage` and persist it, so they follow
message state rather than media.

**3.7a is done, and it did not fold into `LidMappingStore`.** The plan above said to merge the
session alias map into `LidMappingStore`, whose own header says it exists to replace exactly that.
The endpoint is right; one step is not how to get there, for two reasons.

`LidMappingStore` is async throughout (`GetLidForPnAsync`, `GetPnForLidAsync`). Canonicalization is
synchronous, sits on the incoming-message path, and is reached from ViewModels and XAML code-behind
— roughly ninety call sites inside the client and sixty outside, with `IJidResolver.GetCanonicalJid`
synchronous in the Core contract. Converting that means making all of it async, or blocking on async
on the UI thread, or keeping a synchronous cache in front — and the third is what the alias map
already was. Separately, the two disagree on keys: `LidMappingStore` keys by user part and
re-attaches the device suffix on read, while the alias map holds whole normalized JIDs and carries
special handling for LID-shaped `@s.whatsapp.net` identifiers plus the self-poisoning guards.
Merging without reconciling that changes canonicalization, which is what decides chat identity and
duplicate chats.

So 3.7a extracted instead: `JidAliasTable` in `Unison.Core/State` owns the map *and* the rules that
read it — `GetCanonicalJid`, `IsSelfLinked`, `IsSelfJid`, `IsLidLike`, `GetCanonicalSelfPnJid`. Both
moved verbatim. The client keeps its private methods as one-line forwards, so no call site changed.
`JidResolver` now reads the table directly rather than wrapping the client, and `IJidResolver` gained
`IsSelfLinked` — which let `GroupMetadataReader` drop the two delegates 3.2a gave it and take the
resolver, closing that note.

The table learns the logged-in account through `BindSelf`, two functions rather than two strings.
The account's own LID arrives after pairing and is written in place on the existing auth state, so a
snapshot taken at construction would be a snapshot of null and the self-poisoning guards would
quietly stop firing.

3.7b is the storage swap behind this seam: reconcile the key shapes, then let the table read
`LidMappingStore` through its memory cache. Nothing above it has to change again.

**3.5a is done: reading left, the tally stayed.** `ReceiptReader` turns a `<receipt>` node into
`ReceiptFacts` — status, message ids, chat, participant, whether it is a group — and counts how many
distinct other people a group message has to reach. It takes `IJidResolver`, which 3.7a made a real
implementation rather than a wrapper.

`RegisterGroupReceipt` and the recipient-count cache stayed in the client: both live under
`_messageStateLock` alongside the rest of message state, and moving them means moving that lock,
which is 3.9.

Two traps worth recording, because both fail silently rather than loudly:

- Recipient counting is **not** `GroupMetadataReader.CountMembers`. That one counts the roster,
  trusts the `size` attribute and includes the account itself. Reusing it would set a target no set
  of receipts can meet, and group messages would never show as read.
- `CountRecipients` returns `int?`, not `int`. A response with no group node and a group that counts
  nobody are different facts: the original cached the second for thirty minutes and retried the
  first. Collapsing them to `0` would have re-queried group metadata on every incoming receipt.

**3.8's premise no longer holds.** The step was written as "each applier goes to the façade of that
fact, and `AppStateSyncService` talks to façades rather than the concrete client". The second half
cannot be done: `AppStateSyncService.cs` is **not in the csproj**, exactly like `SocketClient.cs`. It
takes a `SocketClient` in its constructor, nothing builds it, and the only reference left to it is a
comment. Repointing it would be a day spent on a file the compiler never sees.

The live path replaced it and is already inside the client — `SocketBridge` calls back in:

```
bridge.SelfPushNameChanged = name => ApplyAppStateSelfPushNameAsync(name);
bridge.GroupSubjectChanged = (jid, subject) => ApplyGroupSubjectAsync(jid, subject);
bridge.ChatDeleted        = jid => ApplyAppStateDeleteChatAsync(jid);
bridge.MessageDeleted     = key => ApplyAppStateDeleteMessageAsync(key.RemoteJid, key.Id);
```

So there is no external caller left to repoint, and the first half — moving the appliers themselves —
is not a separate step either. `ApplyAppStateReadStateAsync`, `ApplyAppStateDeleteChatAsync`,
`ApplyAppStateChatFlagsAsync` and `ForgetChatInStorageAsync` all mutate `Chats`, unread counts and
the message stores. Moving them *is* moving chat state, which is 3.9.

**3.8 is therefore folded into 3.9** rather than sequenced before it. Nothing is lost: the appliers
were always going to follow the state they write.

**3.9a is done: the order left, the state did not.** `ChatDisplayOrder` in `Unison.Core/Helpers`
owns `Compare`, `Reposition` and `SortInPlace` — sibling to `ChatMessageOrder`, which already did the
same job one level down for messages. Ordering is a rule about `ChatItem`, and `ChatStateStore`,
which owns the collection, is in Core too; only the client was in the way.

Moved verbatim, including the part that is easy to mistake for an optimisation worth rewriting:
`SortInPlace` scans for the first out-of-place row before touching anything, because the list is
usually already ordered and every `Move` is a collection-changed notification the `ListView` has to
act on. On a phone with a few hundred chats that check is the difference between a sync that scrolls
and one that stutters.

This was picked as the first slice of 3.9 because it is the half the compiler can vouch for. The
rest — persistence, preview reconciliation, and the app-state appliers folded in from 3.8 — all
write chat state under the client's locks, and that is 3.9b.

**Before starting 3.9b, read this.** Phases 3.1a through 3.9a were all chosen on one criterion:
the compiler could vouch for them. A moved pure function that loses a caller does not build. That
criterion is exhausted — everything left (3.9b, 3.6, 3.10) writes mutable state under the client's
locks, where a mistake builds cleanly and shows up as a chat that stopped saving.

Two misses in the extraction bear this out: the constructor-ordering crash in 3.7a, which only
appeared at runtime, and `CountRecipients` collapsing "no group node" into "zero recipients" in 3.5a,
caught by re-reading the diff *after* a green build.

So `tests/Unison.Core.Tests` now exists (net9.0, xUnit, `dotnet test`). It pins the order rule, the
name blacklist, the extension mapping, `ToUtc` and the `JidAliasTable` canonicalization rules.

Writing the alias tests turned up something 3.9b and 3.7b both need to know. The self-poisoning guard
in `GetCanonicalJid` does not cover the case its comment claims: when a contact's LID is aliased
straight to our id, the guard's own `IsSelfLinked` call consults that alias, returns true, and
disables the guard. The pair was refused upstream by `TryRecordAliasMapping` on the live path, but
the startup restore in `.Connection.cs` wrote persisted aliases into the table directly, without that
check — so anything that reached disk came back on every launch. The restore now drops such a pair
through `IsSelfPoisoningAliasPair`, which works precisely because it asks *before* inserting; the
in-table guard asks afterwards, when the entry is its own alibi, and is left as it is. Both
behaviours are pinned by tests marked as recorded rather than endorsed. 3.9b re-keys persisted rows
by canonical address, so it inherits whatever this table says. That is the regression net for 3.9b: the order
tests fail if the move changes what the user sees in the list. It is not full cover — persistence
and the appliers are in the UWP head and out of its reach — so 3.9b still wants a device pass. It is
the difference between a silent reorder and a red test.

**3.9b has started: the pending message queue is out.** `PendingMessageQueue` (`Unison.Core/State`)
owns what is queued for SQLite and the rule for when to write it, replacing seven fields and a lock
that were spread across three files. The dedupe rule that was written twice — queue and requeue — is
now in one method.

The seam is the return value: `Add` answers with a `PendingFlushAction` and the host runs the timer
or the flush. That keeps the decision atomic inside the queue's lock while the platform work happens
outside it, which is the general shape for the rest of 3.9b — the rule moves to Core, the I/O and the
UI thread stay in the host.

Taking this one first was deliberate. It is the message persistence path, where a mistake compiles
cleanly and surfaces as messages that never land, and it is only takeable now because the queue is
deterministic given a clock reading and therefore testable. Thirty tests cover it. What is still in
the client is genuinely platform: the `Timer`, the SQLite write, the diagnostics.

**The persist debounce followed, and closed a race.** `PersistScheduler` owns whether the catalogue
owes a save and whether startup is still warming up. Those two flags used to disagree about their
lock: `SchedulePersist` read the suppression flag inside `_persistLock`, while `EnableScheduledPersist`
read *and wrote* it outside, beside a `_persistPending` read that was inside. Two callers lifting
suppression together could both decide they owed the deferred save. Lifting is now one atomic step,
and the three outcomes are a return value rather than a flag the caller has to re-derive.

Both slices leave the same residue in the client, and it is the right residue: a `System.Threading.Timer`
and a database call. The rule about *whether* to act is in Core with tests; the platform work that
follows is in the host.

**Thread affinity:** today the client mutates `Chats` on the UI thread; VMs read on the UI thread; `ChatStateStore`’s extra dictionaries are protected by that, not only by the lock. Any code moved to a façade that runs off-thread must use `UpsertChatsAsync` / `UpsertMessagesAsync` (or `IDispatcher`). Do not split 3.9 into half-moves.

**Canonical JID:** introduce `IJidResolver` in phase 1 as a thin wrapper so 3.2 / 3.6 / 3.7 do not all rewrite aliasing at once.

### Phase 4 — What remains is connection

Rename-able to `IWhatsAppConnection` / keep `IWhatsAppService` until the last caller dies. Target surface:

- `InitializeAsync` / `ConnectAsync` / `ResumeAsync` / `EnsureConnectedAsync` / `Disconnect`
- `IsConnected` / `IsTransportReady`
- `IsRegisteredAsync` / `ClearSessionAsync` / `NotifyServerLogoutAsync`
- Suspend / broker / `ReleaseMemoryAsync` / `ShutdownAsync`
- Raw events **for façades only**

Drop `RunOnUiThreadAsync` (`IDispatcher`) and `SchedulePersistPublic` (the writer persists). `App` lifecycle calls `IConnectionService`, not `App.GetWhatsAppService()`.

**Done when:** `.Connection.cs` + a small main file; no façade needs send/history/avatar/group/list methods on the client; leftover `IWhatsAppSocket` drop is [Migration](Migration) item 9, after this.

---

## Risks (do not skip)

1. **UI-thread mutations of `Chats`.** Off-thread `ObservableCollection` writes crash the list. Use `IChatStateStore` APIs that marshal.
2. **`GetCanonicalJid` everywhere.** Wrapper first (phase 1), table move later (3.7).
3. **Do not register** resurrected `MessageService` / `ContactService` / `ConnectionService` / `ProfileService` under `Services/WhatsApp/` — deleted on purpose; live types are `*Facade`.
4. **Broker transfer** still returns false on `SocketBridge`. Unrelated to this extraction; see [Background broker](Background-Broker).
